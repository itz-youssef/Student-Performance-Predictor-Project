Developed an end-to-end Machine Learning system to predict student academic performance (Pass/Fail) based on behavioral and academic features such as study hours, attendance rate, assignment completion, sleep patterns, and social media usage.
Performed comprehensive Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), handled data preprocessing (missing values, encoding, scaling), and built a structured preprocessing pipeline using Scikit-learn. Trained and compared multiple classification models including Logistic Regression and Random Forest, achieving up to 90% accuracy.
Evaluated model performance using accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrix.
The final model was optimized and prepared for deployment as a web-based prediction tool.
Technologies: Python, Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib
